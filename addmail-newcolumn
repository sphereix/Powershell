#This script imports a CSV file, loops through each row in the CSV, adds "+infra" before the @ symbol in the email address, adds the modified email address to a new column called "NewEmail", and then exports the modified CSV to a new file.

#You'll need to replace the $csvPath and $outputPath variables with the actual paths to your input and output CSV files. Also, make sure that your input CSV file has a header row with a column called "Email".
