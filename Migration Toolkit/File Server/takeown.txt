Takeown.exe Options and Parameters
Takeown.exe has several options and parameters that allow you to customize its behavior according to your needs. Understanding these options is crucial for using the tool effectively. Here are the key options and parameters:

/S <system>:
The remote system to connect to, such as another client machine or a server.
/F <filename or directory>:
Specifies the file or folder path you want to take ownership of.
Example for a file:
takeown /f "C:\path\to\file.ext"
Example for a folder (including subdirectories):
takeown /f "C:\path\to\folder" /r /d y
/R:
Makes the Takeown.exe command apply recursively to all files and subfolders within the specified folder. This is useful when you want to take ownership of an entire directory tree.
Example:
takeown /f "C:\path\to\folder" /r /d y
/D {Y|N}:

Example:
takeown /f "C:\path\to\folder" /r /d y

Example:
takeown /f "C:\path\to\file.ext" /u "username"
